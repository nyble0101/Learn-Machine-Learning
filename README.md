# Learn-Machine-Learning
Tools, tutorials and lessons for helping you to learn machine learning


My goal is to supply those who are interested in learning about A.I and machine learning the tools and resources I've found along my journey in mathematics, algorithmic design and data structures which lead to me getting involved in the A.I industry.  
I will aim to update this list as I find more resources.  One of the things I've found to be helpful is finding visual tools that I could play with that explained the concept in a visual way. Not all of the time are there visual tools available so to counter
this I learned to draw the concept on papaer the way I perceive it and then go back and reread the topic.  Some of my drawings are objects while others are the way I perceive it from a math perspective.  Ultimately you will need to not look at your desire to 
learn about AI and machine learning as a challenge but you should look at it as an exploration. 


Math Sites I've found helpful.
